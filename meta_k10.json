    "5": "Table of Contents\nLIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA\nFamily Metrics\nThe numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the\nnumbers of our daily active people (DAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who\nvisited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are\ninherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our\nestimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for\ncalculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or\nadjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as\ndata limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base\nthat have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further\nbelow, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such\nmargin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across\nproducts to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do\nnot match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example,\nto match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user\nnames. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the\nfuture contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products,\nwe have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with\naccounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product\ndecisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy\n4",
    "6": "Table of Contents\nof our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies\nevolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or\nmachine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of\n2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited\nsample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated\nwith Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\nperiod. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates.\nUser Geography\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by\nuser location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is\nestimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's\nactual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the\nuser's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\n5",
    "7": "Table of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\nWe build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and\nshare with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, augmented reality (AR), and\nwearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos,\nvideos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by\naccessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build\nthe next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies.\nWhile the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful,\nand immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery\nengine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that\nmake our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI\nglasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from\nselling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a\nrange of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery\nengine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure\ncapacity.\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in\nFoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical\ninfrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and\nwearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other\nfoundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development\nacross these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may\nonly be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our\nRL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the next computing platform is dependent\non generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now\nbecause we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around\nadvertising, hardware, and digital goods.\n6",
    "8": "Table of Contents\nFamily of Apps Products\n• Facebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a place for people to share life's\nmoments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover and connect to people with shared interests, and create economic\nopportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, Marketplace, and more.\n• Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Live, and messaging are places\nwhere people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their\nfavorite businesses.\n• Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses\nacross platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls.\n• Threads. Threads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come together to discuss topics of interest.\nPeople can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who love the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their\nideas, opinions, and creativity with the world.\n• WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses around the world to\ncommunicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a one-to-many broadcast service designed to help\npeople follow information from people and organizations that are important to them.\nReality Labs Products\nMany of our Reality Labs investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market\ntoday and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets\npeople control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the near term,\nwe are continuing to develop early metaverse and wearables products and experiences that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.\nOur metaverse efforts include our VR, MR, and social platform initiatives. Our current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well\nas software and content available through the Meta Horizon Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while\nengaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. To drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have introduced MR capabilities, which allow users\nto experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest devices.\nOur wearables efforts include our AR initiatives. We have continued to advance our roadmap to include additional AI-enabled offerings such as the Ray-\nBan Meta AI glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as other features such as hands-free interaction. As we continue our\nlong-term efforts to bring AR glasses to market, in 2024 we also unveiled our Orion prototype, a pair of true AR glasses that overlay content on top of the\nphysical world. It does this with an industry-leading field of view and in glasses form factor for comfortable wear.\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the next computing platform, our metaverse efforts also\ninclude notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our wearables efforts are primarily directed toward\nlonger-term research and development projects. For example, in 2025, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our\nwearables initiatives, and the remaining 50% on our metaverse initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are\ncertain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the next computing platform and our business strategies\nevolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and\nmarket landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\n7",
    "9": "Table of Contents\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing,\ndiscovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or\ndevelop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but\nnot limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to\nreach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use\nour free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We\nalso compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual reality products and services. We also expect to\nface additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and\nservices, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the\nmetaverse.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that\nour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with\nproducts like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed\nand built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third\nparties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network\ncapacity.\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers\nand developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen\nour systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things,\nrecommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery,\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.\nWe also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our Llama models, consisting of state-of-the-art foundation models that are\navailable for researchers and developers to use and build upon. By making our Llama models openly available, we aim to accelerate AI research and\ndevelopment, improve our own products, and to foster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that\nis focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-\nmaking to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers.\nWe operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to\nprovide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers, resellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel,\nMeta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta AI\nglasses.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to\nstimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help\nbuild community around the world.\n8",
    "10": "Table of Contents\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license\nagreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other\ncontractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties.\nWe do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the\nduration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still\nevolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including\nprivacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of\npublicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\ndata disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions,\nor other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and\nregulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in the past and could in the future\nadversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by\nimposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral\nargument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230)\nwas at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation\nconcerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online platforms under\nSection 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\nIf we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products\nand services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely\naffect our financial results. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European\nUnion to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union\n(CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to\nregulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May\n12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine\nof EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into\ncompliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage,\n9",
    "11": "Table of Contents\nof such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on\nMarch 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n(EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities\n(E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General\nas a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United\nStates. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union\nto organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States\nDepartment of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome\nmilestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two\nprior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty\nand lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\nunder the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead\nEuropean Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other\nrequirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations\nby the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes\nin the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those\nregulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a\nresult, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and\nother countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their\nrespective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency\nrules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to\ncontrol the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford\nusers with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents\nor guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and\nservices provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the\nePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which\ncould directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the\nuse of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these\nor similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory\ndevelopments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European\nEconomic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no\nads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets\nAct (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our\n\"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our\nmodel does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the European Data Protection\nBoard has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding\nour compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union,\nEuropean Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads,\n10",
    "12": "Table of Contents\nwhich are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our\nuser growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European\nUnion imposes restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and\nacquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated\ngatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our\nproducts or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future\nproposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to\nour business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have\npassed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar\nrequirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering\nof our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to\ncollect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For\nexample, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to\nminors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of\nthem) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders\nmay expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be\nenjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent\nlegislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain\nsocial media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of\nexisting laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by\nthird parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could\nsubject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions.\nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government\nauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data\nprotection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject\nrights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise\nobjectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees,\nincluding the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things,\nrequired us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our\ncompliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court,\nthat alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its\ncurrent form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years\nold. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us\nto civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our\nbusiness practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business.\n11",

We are\ncommitted to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are focused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We\noffer competitive compensation and a wide range of benefits, including many learning and development resources.\nFrom time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, we\nhave previously undertaken cost reduction efforts such as scaling back budgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and employee\nlayoffs and restructurings. We make it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and provide a generous severance package. For U.S. employees, that\nincludes severance payments, payment for all remaining paid time off, and restricted stock unit vesting through their last day on payroll, as well as certain\ncontinuing coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families, career services with an external vendor, and immigration support. We offer\nsimilar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States while taking into account local employment laws.\nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees with regular performance reviews\ntwice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth and career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at\nMeta. We also offer career development opportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we\nutilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning communities,\nand coaching engagements.\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help us understand how employees feel about working at Meta and what we can do to\nimprove their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal experience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such\nas those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and\ncompany changes. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the company.\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our\nemployees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees\nequity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We\nhave conducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. For example, in September 2024, we announced that we\ncontinue to have pay equity for gender globally and ethnicity in the United States.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we continue to provide our employees and their dependents with resources to help them thrive.\nWe offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community,\n12",

Our\nprograms are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health, create financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees\nbuild a strong community.\nThe Strength of Our Workforce and People Processes\nIn early 2025, we announced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape. We will continue to work to build an\ninclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community\nwe serve.\nWe want our products to work for people around the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to do that.

These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to,\nrisks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\n• our ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\n• the loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\n• reduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\n• ineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners;\n• failure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\n• our ability to compete effectively;\n• fluctuations in our financial results;\n• unfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\n• our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service, catastrophic events, and\ncrises;\n• operating our business in multiple countries around the world;\n• litigation, including class action lawsuits;\n• acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\n• government restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell or deliver advertising, in their\ncountries;\n• complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use, data combination, data protection, content and content moderation, competition, youth,\nsafety, consumer protection, advertising, and other laws and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Digital\nMarkets Act (DMA), Digital Services Act (DSA), Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), and the UK Digital Markets, Competition and\nConsumer Act (DMCC);\n• the impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and investigations by privacy, consumer\nprotection, and competition authorities, among others;\n14",
    "16": "Table of Contents\n• our ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\n• the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents, as well as intentional\nmisuse of our services and other undesirable activity on our platform;\n• our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\n• limitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual class structure of our common\nstock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock by our founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO).\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and\nbusiness may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our active user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been\nand will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions,\nparticularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our\nproducts and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to\nincreases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in\nconnection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian\ngovernment, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any future declines in the size of our active\nuser base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or\nincrease the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their\nactive user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and\nour competitors introduce new and different products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement,\nincluding if:\n• users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\n• we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to\nexisting products and services, that are not favorably received;\n• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and\nquality of ads that we display;\n• users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we\nrely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\n• user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;\n• we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems\nand networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n15",

If we are unable to\nmaintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue\nand financial results may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to\nusers, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become\nincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to grow revenue.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our\nbusiness.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, our\nmarketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising\nbudget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they\nare not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes\nreduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business.

The occurrence of any of these or other\nfactors in the future, including our enforcement efforts, could result in a reduction in marketer spend or demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we\nreceive for our ads, could cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, or could otherwise negatively affect our revenue and financial results, and\ncould be material.\n18",
    "20": "Table of Contents\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals\ngenerated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals\ngenerated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect\nour business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the\nCCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the\nnumber of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy\nDirective compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other\nU.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing\nadditional rights for users and could result in restrictions on our use of signals from third-party apps and websites through certain browser- and device-based\nuniversal opt-out mechanisms. Judicial and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may\nrequire us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For\nexample, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began\noffering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with\nrequirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding\nthe compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the\nEuropean Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have\nraised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in\nthe European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less\npersonalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future\nplans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple\nmade certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers'\nability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users\nthe ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising\nrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS\nchanges beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities\nwill be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\nproducts, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue\nto feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability\nof our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS\noperating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have\nmade in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products,\ngive preferential treatment to\n19",

For example,\nApple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to\nour users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own\nadvertising business. In addition, Google previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to\nApple's, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization.\nAdditionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products,\nsystems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser\ndevelopers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that\noperate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our\nproducts on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access\nto our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products\nor the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our\nrelationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or\nadvertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by\nthese actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our\nbusiness could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that\nwe do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which\nmay in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing\nproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant\nchanges to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior\ndevelopment or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed\nreality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making\nsignificant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For example, we continue to launch new AI features on our products,\nincluding support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be\nsuccessful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of\nsuch products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue\nor profits from messaging over the long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and\nInstagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney General is seeking to enjoin\nour offering of default end-to-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail\nto attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely\naffected.\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our\nproducts, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will\nrequire increased investment in infrastructure and headcount. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance could\nbe harmed.\n20",
    "22": "Table of Contents\nThere are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or\nservices or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. For example, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI,\nsubject us to risks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation and deepfakes (including related to elections), bias, discrimination, toxicity,\nconsumer protection, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among\nothers. It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition,\nwe are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer\nperceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies in\njurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering applying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, export controls, and\ndata protection laws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI (such as the recently passed EU AI Act). We may not always be able to\nanticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these\nframeworks as they are still rapidly evolving. We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain\njurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and technologies. Other companies may\ndevelop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of\ndevelopment in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with\nour ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to\ncontinue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and physical\ninfrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, as to which we cannot control the\navailability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that\ncan use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize\nsuch AI technologies. As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the\ndissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination,\ncybersecurity attacks including spear phishing attacks, data privacy violations, other activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or to\ndevelop competing technologies. While we may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and\nthe inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be\neffective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments\nregarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal\nliability.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent\nwith our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which\nhas to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our \"Your Activity off-Meta Technologies\"\ntool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to\ndeliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly,\n21",
    "23": "Table of Contents\nfrom time to time we update our Feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features to improve the user experience, and these changes have had, and\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products, which could adversely affect our financial\nresults. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we\nhave made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers,\nand developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing\nproducts, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of\nmonetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these\nefforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize\nless successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower\nrate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not\nproduce the long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nOur Reality Labs efforts include our metaverse and wearables initiatives. We believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive\nexperiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to\nfocus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation\ninterfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued\ninvestment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants.\nHowever, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.\nWe regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our\nproduct ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed\nreality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development\nefforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse\ntechnologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-\nparty mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own\ncompeting products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to\ncontinue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support\nthese efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to\na variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition,\ncontent regulation, tariffs, export controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services,\nincrease our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our\nReality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or\nfinancial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired,\nand our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is\ncritical to maintaining and expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and\nenhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the\nactions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our\nproducts or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our\nactions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users,\nand other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and\n22",

For example, in January 2025, we announced certain changes to our content policies and\nenforcement efforts to further free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies. Beginning in September 2021,\nwe became the subject of media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents\nrelating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other\nundesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the\nsharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are illegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce\nour policies, address objectionable content or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode\nconfidence in our brands.\nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users\nacting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to\nmanipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain\ncontent on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around geopolitical\nevents or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent\nOversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, by our decisions\nregarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service, or by any\nnegative sentiment associated with our management.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our\nactions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and\nother content, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications that integrate with our products.\nSuch existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement.\nAdditionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that integrate\nwith our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience,\nand we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions\nto reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions\nhave reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part\nof our efforts related to privacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have\nannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our\npolicies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain\ngood relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies\nthat sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns.

We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our\nproducts, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual\nreality products and services. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as\nother companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new\ntechnologies, as well as efforts to develop the metaverse.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments,\ngeographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political,\nlegal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than\nus to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively\nengaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of\nand engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we make updates to our products\nand services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users\nincreasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which\ncase our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching\nand successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive\nadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads;\nby imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it\nmore difficult to communicate with our users; by limiting the ability of our devices or products to interoperate with their popular platforms or products; or by\nintegrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-\ncommerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has\nreleased changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads effectively. As a result, our\ncompetitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would\nnegatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure\nyou that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n• the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;\n• the size and composition of our user base;\n• the engagement of users with our products and competing products;\n• our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\n• the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;\n• our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;\n• our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\n• our ability to monetize our products;\n• the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\n24",

Our reputation has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by unfavorable\npublicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies, product decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government\nsurveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services\nfor illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the\nquality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, our management, or the\nactions of other companies that provide similar services to ours. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns\naround our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative\npublicity related to these topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the release of\ninternal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our\nhandling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with geopolitical events and elections in\nthe United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and\nmarketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have\nexperienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nWe are subject to the risk of catastrophic events and crises, which may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of public health crises such as pandemics, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorism,\ngeopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, power loss, cyber-attacks, and other catastrophic events and crises. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic\npreviously significantly impacted our business and results of operations. In particular, the pandemic led to volatility in the demand for and pricing of our\nadvertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experience similar effects in the future as a result of the pandemic or other\ncatastrophic events. Such events also expose our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including: volatility in the size of our user base\nand user engagement; delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of\ninventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages; significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future; illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce,\nwhich may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the\nbasis for estimates used in our financial statements. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or\nregulatory actions against us.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in our artificial intelligence initiatives\nas well as Reality Labs, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business\nand financial performance will be harmed.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as\nusers increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement\nnew products, as we market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest\nin new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content and\nadvertising review and enforcement.

In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and\nregulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including\nas part of our metaverse and wearables efforts. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in Reality Labs, have generated only limited\nrevenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable\nfuture. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2024 overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we expect our Reality\nLabs investments and operating losses to increase in 2025. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be\nharmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our products and services\ncould damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and services and our\nunderlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and\nservices from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid\nperformance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products or services are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they\ndo not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products or services as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any\nof which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. In addition, as\nthe amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve,\nand as our internal operational demands continue to grow, especially with the deployment of AI technologies, we will need an increasing amount of technical\ninfrastructure, including network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, to continue to satisfy our needs. Although we are making\nsignificant investments in our technical infrastructure, it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to\naccommodate these increased demands or achieve our business objectives, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue. In\naddition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power\nloss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events and crises. Global climate change could result in\ncertain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject to service\ndisruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which\nmay adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to maintain the\navailability or performance of our products and services in connection with any such events.\nA substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers\ncould harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face\nmay adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they\nprovide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various challenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure.\nAs a result, we have adjusted, and may continue to adjust in the future, our procurement practices to adapt to the evolving landscape. We may not be able to\nsecure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or\nservices on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products or services, require unfavorable changes to\nexisting products or services, delay the introduction of future products or services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have experienced, and could experience in the future, difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan to\ncontinue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects.\nThe infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in developing regions that\nexpose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance, trade compliance, and political challenges, among others. We have\n28",

Additional unanticipated\ndelays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due to the availability of components, power or network capacity, or any shortage of labor\nnecessary in building portions of such projects, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions\nby governments, whether as a result of trade disputes or otherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery\nor degradation of the quality or reliability of our products and services, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. For example, like others in our industry,\nwe rely on certain third-party equipment and components for our technical infrastructure that are manufactured by a small number of third parties, often with\nsignificant operations in a single region such as Asia. Any of the foregoing delays or disruptions, including actions by governments or geopolitical events such\nas international conflicts, could result in tariffs, sanctions, export or import controls, and other measures that restrict international trade, could reduce or\neliminate the ability of our suppliers, manufacturers, or other third-party providers to continue their operations to manufacture, or limit or eliminate our ability\nto purchase, key components of our technical infrastructure.\nIn addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may\nonly become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs.\nFurther, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such government\naction, has resulted, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the\nquality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), are calculated using internal company data based on\nthe activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The\nmethodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We\nregularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve\ntheir accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or\nother factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics\nfor any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as\ndata limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base\nthat have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further\nbelow, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such\nmargin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across\nproducts to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\n29",
    "31": "Table of Contents\nsignificantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or\ntrends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example,\nto match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user\nnames. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the\nfuture contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products,\nwe have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with\naccounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product\ndecisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy\nof our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies\nevolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or\nmachine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of\n2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited\nsample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated\nwith Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\nperiod. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in\nusage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.\nAccordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by\nuser location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is\nestimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's\nactual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the\nuser's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our\nads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our\nsystems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology,\nincluding as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to\nlitigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, or investors\ndo not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material\n30",

The scale of our business and breadth of\nour products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users,\nmarketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the scale and\ncomplexity of our business. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial, and management processes\nand systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to\nchallenges in productivity and collaboration. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\nbusiness and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives, including restructurings, employee layoffs, and measures to\nscale down our office facilities. These efforts also subject us to risks such as greater than anticipated costs, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased\ndifficulty managing the scale and complexity of our business. For example, we could face delays or challenges with product development, other business and\nstrategic initiatives, or legal and regulatory compliance, as well as other disruptions to our operations. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are\nrequired to implement and adapt complex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture,\nincluding our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Any of these developments could negatively affect our business, reputation,\nor financial results.\nWe have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations. We currently make our Family products available in a total of more than 100 different languages, and we\nhave offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international regions where we have limited or no experience in\nmarketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be\navailable in certain regions due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available in China. We also\noutsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business\nmay suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n• political, social, or economic instability;\n• risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions,\nincluding with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual\nproperty, environmental, health and safety, accessibility, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\n• potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user\ninformation to local authorities;\n• enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards, terms of service, and other policies across\ndifferent languages and countries;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\n• foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the\nUnited States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;\n• higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n• enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\n• burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal,\n31",

We also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and sanctions,\nincluding regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal\npenalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions,\nsanctions, and other laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely\naffected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a\nresult of the risks described above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks with respect to our consumer hardware products that, if not properly managed, could adversely\nimpact our financial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. For\nexample, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or\nmanufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\nmanufacturers or suppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers'\nexpectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a\nnumber of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products depends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a\nsingle region such as Asia. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages, strikes or other disruptions in logistics and the\nsupply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if\nwe are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of\nsuch arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by\nmacroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments or non-state actors (including international conflicts,\ntariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or\nlogistics disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding\nsourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their\npractices and standards and have experienced violations of these requirements from time to time. If any supplier or business partner violates laws, fails to\nimplement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could\nexperience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\n32",
    "34": "Table of Contents\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, unsafe or\ndefective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products, higher tariffs that increase consumer prices, and other factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly\nbetween the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer\ndemand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international regions, it may be\ndifficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain\ntypes of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may\nadversely affect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could\nharm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutory\ndamages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future.\nBecause of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages\neven if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action\nand other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and\nsoftware, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class\naction suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well\nas other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements,\nresulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of biometric technology, our\nalleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools, our alleged use of\ncopyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users and allegations of\nviolations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any\nnegative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business\npractices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a\nsignificant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be\nreversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has\noccurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and\nmay adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary\ncompanies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be\nable to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or at all,\nincluding as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023 following the United Kingdom Competition and\nMarkets Authority's order directing us to divest Giphy post-acquisition. In addition, although we were able to successfully complete the acquisition after\nprevailing in federal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other\nstrategic transactions may be substantial, and there is\n33",
    "35": "Table of Contents\nno assurance that we will realize expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our\nstrategic investments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and could\nadversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include\ncovenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we\nregularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results,\nand result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users,\nmarketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance,\nwhich may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence\nare dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as\nwell as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or\nother strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these\nfactors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that\ndevelop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make,\nsubstantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of resources and\nmanagement attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the\ncompanies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements,\nincluding the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our\nintercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation\nand certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are\nsubject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken,\nincluding our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could\nincrease our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in\nconjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate\nresolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are\nmany transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for\nincome taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial\nstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\n34",
    "36": "Table of Contents\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition\nof deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate\nfor the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions\nin the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued\nor such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have\nenacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we\noperate our business.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit\nShifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\ncountries in which we do business. A number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the OECD’s 15% global minimum tax regime. As additional\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\ntax payments could increase in future years. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various\naspects of the current international tax rules under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing rules to calculate income tax, as well as\nproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have\nproposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to\nour business. There are ongoing OECD negotiations that contemplate an alternative to these proposals, which may proliferate in the absence of multilateral\nagreement.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides\npreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state\naid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described\nabove could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position,\nresults of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts\nestimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary, significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our effective tax rate,\nsometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that\nperiod, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2024, excess tax benefits recognized from\nshare-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $3.22 billion and our effective income tax rate by five percentage points as compared to\nthe tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in\nthat period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular\nperiod will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price,\nwhich we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\n35",

We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible\nassets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or\nintangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg and certain other\nmembers of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of\nserious injury and death. If Mr. Zuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations. The loss of\nother key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could also disrupt\nour operations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. In particular, we\nexpect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring specialized technical personnel, particularly senior engineering talent, whether as a result of\ncompetition with other companies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity\nawards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our\nexisting employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further\ndiluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition, restrictive immigration\npolicies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our\nexisting personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be\nunable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors\nand any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control,\nmerger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in\nthe consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from\nacquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his\nposition as our CEO and his ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital\nstock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a\nstockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases\nand dividend payments could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us to\nrepurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A common stock.

We\ncannot guarantee that the repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase program and\ndividend payments could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this repurchase program or\ndividend payments may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this repurchase program and dividend payments will diminish our\ncash reserves.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nThe payment of any cash dividends in the future is subject to continued capital availability, market conditions, applicable laws and agreements, and our\nboard of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. The declaration and payment of any\ndividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time, and there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts,\nor at all.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate content on our products in their\ncountries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell or deliver advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our\nproducts from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended\nperiod of time or indefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\nChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in\nviolation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from\ntime to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and\nblock access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong\nhas passed additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other\noperations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In\naddition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were\nthen prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell or deliver advertising, including in countries where access\nto our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving\nadvertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese, United States, or other government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based\nadvertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, including any tariffs implemented by the United States or China, in\nresponse to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or\nother penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to\nreduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or\nour other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make\nchanges to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base,\nuser engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and\nour financial results could be adversely affected.\n37",

Many of these laws and regulations are subject to\nchange and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of\noperations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data\nuse, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity,\ncontent, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data\ndisclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions,\nor other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and\nregulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we\nprovide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global\nrevenue.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\nFor example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States,\ncalled the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought\nby the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final\nDecision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland’s reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to\nsuspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including\nstorage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court.\nOn March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy\nFramework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence\nActivities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States\nAttorney General as a “qualifying state” under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation\nto the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the\nEuropean Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the “Data Privacy Framework List,” maintained and made publicly available by the\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and\nwelcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF\nreplaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create\nconsiderable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a\n38",

If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries\nand regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services,\nthe manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\nunder the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the\nnotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the\nCJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency\nmechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy\nregulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data\nprocessing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our\noperations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related\nrequirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of\ncertain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have\nproposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving\nand subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy\nrights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to\ninterpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting\nour advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may\nlead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and\nnational implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance.\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our\nadvertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising\non Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023\nwe began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding\ncompliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal\nproceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July\n2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer\nprotection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024,\nwe began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported\nby ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any similar\ndevelopments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European\nUnion imposes restrictions and requirements on\n39",
    "41": "Table of Contents\ncompanies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has\ncaused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under\nthe DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of\njurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the DSA, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and\nrequirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation\nand enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In\naddition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new\ncompetition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products,\nincrease the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines\nor other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising\nservices or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas,\nCalifornia, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the\nservices that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to\nthem, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect\nthat may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these\nstatutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users\nunder 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year\nolds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also\nsubject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant\ncompliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or\nother third parties in such transactions. In addition, the Province of British Columbia has considered, and may in the future consider, a bill that would permit\nthe government to recover public health-related costs potentially associated with providing goods and services in British Columbia, including potentially social\nmedia services.\nWe are also subject to disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements regarding our social and environmental risks and initiatives. There has been\nincreased focus on these initiatives by many regulators, investors, and other stakeholders and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable\nfederal, state, local or international laws and regulations could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government actions, have led to, and may in the future\nlead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, changes to our products, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of\nnew products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our\nbusiness, including fines, damages, or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been and remain subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be\nsubject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices\nin a manner materially adverse to our business.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of\nwhich are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data\nprotection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject\nrights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise\nobjectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees. For example, data protection, competition, content, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union, United States, and other jurisdictions\nhave initiated actions,\n40",
    "42": "Table of Contents\ninvestigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do\nthe same. In addition, we have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect and use information,\nincluding where advertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment, credit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March\n2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection\nwith our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms\nand policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among\nother things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and\nlitigation, and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified\nconsent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient\ncompliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and\nseeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we\nwould be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify\nthe IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue\nsimilar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. In addition, we are subject to\ninquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with various provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and\nInstagram, including matters related to elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential\ndeceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and\nrequirements to change our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, in July 2024, we entered into a settlement to resolve a\nlawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology.\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and\nother jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits\nconcern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services, digital advertising, and/or\nmobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by\nthe FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including\nby acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission\nissued a fine as a result of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition\nrules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a\nformer employee.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose\nus to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change\nour business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other\nregulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance\nfailures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC,\nrequirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative\n41",
    "43": "Table of Contents\nrequirements around the world, such as U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, EU AI Act, the Korean Personal\nInformation Protection Act, and the Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in\nconnection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting\nobligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the\nFTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to\nmaintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing\ninvestments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually reallocate resources internally to assist\nwith these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial\nmodifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result,\nwe believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected.\nFurther, our privacy compliance and oversight efforts have required, and we expect will continue to require, significant time and attention from our\nmanagement and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly\nto our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise\ndiscover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements\nare constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we are subject to restrictions and requirements under\nthe DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and\nregulatory engagement.\nThe FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with the FTC consent order and seeking\nsubstantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to\nthe composition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. We are challenging the FTC's\nadministrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order in its current form, it would limit our ability to\nprovide certain features and services, engage in certain business practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance\nand oversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any future modifications to the order),\nGDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant\nauthority believes that we are in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations\nor lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines or damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage), judgments, penalties, or\nother remedies, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims\nrelated to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely\naffect our business and financial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims and government and regulatory inquiries relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and investigations relating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement decisions with\nrespect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or\nnews hoaxes, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts,\nlaws regulating hate speech or other types of content, on- or offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or\ndistribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, illegal gaming, and other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity),\nproducts liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For example, over the last several years we have seen an increase in claims\nbrought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. In addition, we\nhave been subject to litigation alleging that our ad targeting and delivery practices constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws.\nThe potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our\nprotection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less\n42",

For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright\nDirective) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which the EU member states have\nsince implemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online\nvideo-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. Additionally, Brazil has an intermediary liability framework limiting liability for third-party\ncontent, which has been challenged as unconstitutional and is under review by the Brazilian Supreme Court. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme\nCourt heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency\nAct (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. There also have been, and continue to be, various other\nlitigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to\nimpose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, including electoral-related and AI-generated content,\ncounterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or\nchange. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial or government-imposed remedies as a\nresult of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or\nother penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in\nEurope, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially significant\npenalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we\nhave been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to\nfines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products\nor business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the\nEuropean Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the\navailability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European\nCopyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services are subject to restrictions and requirements,\nand we are subject to increased compliance costs, and potential fines or other penalties in the event of non-compliance, as a result of the Digital Services Act in\nthe European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, and other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and\nMedia Regulation Act in Ireland and the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may\nrequire us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products. For example, as a result of such legislation in Canada, we have ended the\navailability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the\nFirst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation or investigations may increase our costs or require significant\nchanges to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement.\nAny of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nPayment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other risks that could be costly and difficult to\ncomply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants and\ndevelopers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among\nother activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money\nlaundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual\ncurrency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new\nconsumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments activity as well as sharing, collection, and use\nof payments-related data. For example, the CFPB issued its anticipated Larger Participant Rule, effective January 2025, allowing the CFPB to conduct\nsupervisory activities over general-use digital consumer payment applications. The Rule, which is under legal challenge by a trade association, could subject\ncertain of our payments products to this authority. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations\nincluding those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. We\nhave received certain\n43",
    "45": "Table of Contents\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions for our regulated Payments-related products and activities. These\nlicenses increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve, help mitigate regulatory uncertainty, and will generally require us to demonstrate\ncompliance with many domestic and foreign laws in relation to our regulated Payments products and activities. Our efforts to comply with these laws and\nregulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and attention and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to\nbe in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may\nbe required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management\ntime and attention and other resources to address bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers,\nemployees, or third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements.\nWe have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part\nof our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents\ncould harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service or\notherwise harm us. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or\nmitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from\nusers, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our\nbusiness and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks),\nscraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also\nregularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming,\nspreading misinformation, or other illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and\nvolume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging\ntechnologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-\nsponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address\nundesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide,\ndegrade the user experience or otherwise adversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal\nsystems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to prevent or disable undesirable activities\non our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or\nvendor error or malfeasance; social engineering or other cyber-attacks directed towards our personnel or their access; misuse of company data or systems by\nour personnel; defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government exploitation or surveillance; breaches of\nphysical security of our facilities, technical infrastructure, or other equipment; or other threats that evolve. In addition, other parties may attempt to fraudulently\nor maliciously induce employees, contractors, vendors, or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks\ncontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and\nprocesses that are designed to protect our data and user data, to reduce the risk of data loss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our\nplatform, and to reduce the risk of or detect security breaches, such measures will not provide absolute security, and we cannot assure you that we will be able\nto react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other security incidents, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. Our business and operations span\nnumerous geographies around the world and involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties. At any given\ntime, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our security efforts.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information\nprovided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products.\n44",

In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data\nprotection, including the GDPR and EU member state laws implementing the EU Cybersecurity Directive (NIS2), as well as obligations under our modified\nconsent order with the FTC. As a result, government authorities, affected users, or other parties could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in\nconnection with any actual or perceived security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of data, or other cybersecurity issues, which has occurred in the\npast and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices.

From time to time we are unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. We\nmay also be subject to increased risk as a result of changes to our content policies and enforcement efforts which we began to implement in January 2025 to\nfurther free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies.\nConsequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes\nto our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Such developments have subjected, and\nmay in the future subject, us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's\ntime and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or\nfailures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by third\nparties (including open source software and the operating systems and browsers which users rely on to run our applications and access our systems), that is\nhighly technical and complex.

In addition, we regularly contribute software\nsource code under open source and other permissive licenses and have made other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open\nsource software in our products. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to\nopen source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be\nrequired to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the\nprotection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible\nassets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could\nhave an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are\nexpensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently\nenter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-\npracticing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from\ntechnology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed,\nor introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and\nother rights holders.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services,\ntrademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face\nincreasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending intellectual\nproperty litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final\noutcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any\nsuch litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us\n46",
    "48": "Table of Contents\nto change or cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any\nlitigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such\na settlement or judgment may require us to change or cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may\nhave to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or\nbranding or discontinue the practices or branding. The development of alternative non-infringing technology, branding or practices could require significant\neffort and expense, could result in less effective technology, branding or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We\nhave experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in\nour initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $638.40 through December 31, 2024. In\naddition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the\nfuture fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n• actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n• additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of\nsuch sales;\n• investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint\nventures, or capital commitments;\n• announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or\nthe effectiveness of our ad products;\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and\ncompetitors;\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n• the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\n• media coverage of our business and financial performance;\n• lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\n• adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters,\nincluding interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\n• trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\n47",
    "49": "Table of Contents\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to\nthese events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of\nequity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the\nmisuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the\nsecond quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B\ncommon stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock,\nincluding our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to\ncontrol the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all\noutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the\nforeseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions,\nsuch as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the\neffect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example,\nMr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control\na majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could\nelect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function.\nAccordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same\nprotections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a\ncontrolled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing\nthe trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a\nchange in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes\nan interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and\nbylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our\ncommon stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding\nClass B common stock voting as a separate class;\n• we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters\nrequiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common\nstock;\n48",
    "50": "Table of Contents\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain\namendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding\nshares of Class A and Class B common stock;\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock,\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our\nboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed\nfrom office for cause;\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our\nstockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n• only our board chair, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of\nstockholders;\n• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of\nstockholders;\n• our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be\nissued, without stockholder approval; and\n• certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nAt Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and\nattacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence\nand scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services\nreach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span\nnumerous geographies around the world, involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on\nsoftware and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we\ndiscover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices,\nfor managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, we evaluate a variety of developments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and\nobserved cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes\nin addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts and\nconsultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry practices.\nHowever, we may not be successful in fully addressing such areas for remediation or enhancement. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management\nprogram to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-\nparty privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance on the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy\nprograms and the supporting control frameworks. These processes\n49",
    "51": "Table of Contents\nsupport informed risk-based decision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. Our risk mitigation strategies\ninclude a broad variety of technical and operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.\nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our third-party assessment (TPA) process.\nUnder our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who contract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with\nour systems, in order to help us assess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among other things,\nmaintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of material data breaches that may impact our data.\nOur board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity risk management oversight to the\naudit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight Committee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for\nensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement\nprocesses and programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy & product compliance committee of our board of\ndirectors (Privacy & Product Compliance Committee) oversees risks related to privacy and data use, including overseeing compliance with our comprehensive\nprivacy program. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes\nto ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies\nand procedures, and providing regular reports to our board of directors, including through the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and Privacy & Product\nCompliance Committee.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Guy Rosen, leads our cybersecurity program and oversees teams across the company supporting our\nsecurity functions of identify, prevent, detect, respond, and recover. These teams are comprised of personnel with a broad range of experience across the private\nand public sectors, the technology industry, and different geographic regions. Mr. Rosen has two decades of experience in various cybersecurity, software\ndevelopment, product management, and other technology-related roles. Mr. Rosen has served in a number of significant leadership roles at our company since\n2013, including oversight of security, safety, and integrity initiatives, and was appointed as our CISO in 2022. Prior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served\nin senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles across technology organizations.\nOur cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through a variety of technical and\noperational measures, and regularly report to our CISO. Our CISO is part of the senior management team at the company and regularly updates the Audit &\nRisk Oversight Committee on the company’s cybersecurity program, including cybersecurity risks, incidents, and mitigation strategies.\nIn 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy,\nresults of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that\nwe have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents. For additional information about these risks, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2024, we owned and leased approximately 11 million square feet\nof office and building space for our corporate headquarters and in the surrounding areas, which included approximately two million square feet of unoccupied\noffice and building space that we plan to either sublease, early terminate, or abandon related to our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. We also owned\nand leased approximately 62 acres of land to be developed to accommodate anticipated future growth.\nIn addition, we have offices in more than 90 cities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. We own\n27 data center locations globally and we also lease some data centers at selected locations.\nWe believe that our facilities, which are used by both reportable segments, are adequate for our current needs.\n50",
    "52": "Table of Contents\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to numerous claims, litigation,\nregulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal proceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these\nmatters are without merit and are vigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or\nwe may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide to settle litigation, disputes, or other legal\nproceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us. In addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or\nregulatory authorities. Any such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have\nexperienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in\nlight of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there\ncan be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid\nor limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss,\nincluding through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services\nAct, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining\nguidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various\naspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control\nof data without other damage) and/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements. We are also responding to\nlitigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health\nand safety impacts on users, particularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful\ndiscrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax, competition and antitrust, stockholder,\ncommercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential\nexposure to substantial damages awards and fines has increased.\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where\nthe nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the\nnature and extent of injunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures, disgorgement, fines or penalties.\nWhile we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our\nactivities will not result from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and\ncertain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain\ndata by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors\nappealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal\nTrade Commission (FTC), state\n51",
    "53": "Table of Contents\nattorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order\nto resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and\nprocesses for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions\nremain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or adversely affect our business. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted\nour motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully\nbriefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021,\na stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and\nrelated claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an\namended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current\nand former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second\namended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation. On\nJanuary 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except\nMark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding (In the Matter of Facebook, Inc.) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent\norder, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The\nunderlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to\nrule.\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC),\nasserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On\nDecember 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the\ndistrict court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss\nour complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy (Jarkesy). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending\nappeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy. Following the\nSupreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The\ndistrict court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to\ndismiss.\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was\nlegally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners\non those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta’s jurisdictional challenges currently\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc., and that the nature and scope of any further\nadministrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional\nrequirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate\ncourt to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be\nsuccessful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data\nbreaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under\n52",
    "54": "Table of Contents\nother laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and\nother European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the compliance of our\n\"subscription for no ads\" consent model with requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that\nMeta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to\nsuspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including\nstorage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. On\nOctober 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30,\n2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\"\nunder Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy\ndecision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the\nUnited States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce\npursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and\nwelcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. For additional\ninformation, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data\nuse, data combination, data protection, content, competition, youth, safety, consumer protection, advertising, e-commerce, and other matters\" in this Annual\nReport on Form 10‑K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceedings) could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to\nchange our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals' information from\nthird-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive\nrelief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor, Inc. et al.; Doe v.\nGoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara\nCounty Superior Court). These cases are in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain others\nhave been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in the cases that are most advanced.\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the\nsubject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint (FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc.)\nagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in\n2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss\nthe complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to\ndismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our\nmotion for summary judgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024. On November 13, 2024,\nthe court granted in part and denied in part both our and the FTC’s motions for summary judgment. Trial is set to begin on April 14, 2025. Multiple putative\nclass actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and\nother causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of\nthe cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia (Klein et al., v.

On December 30, 2024,\nwe filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a\nmanner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102\non the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a fine of\napproximately EUR €798 million. We appealed the European Commission's decision on January 28, 2025.\nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model with\nrequirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary\nview that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely\naffect our business.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\nour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court\nin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our\nplatform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17,\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4,\n2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10,\n2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and\nother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics.

Empl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.). On September 30, 2024, the court dismissed certain claims with\nleave to amend, but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed against us and certain of our current\nand former directors and officers.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking\nunspecified damages (Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v.

Putative class actions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school\ndistricts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United States, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations. On\nOctober 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re Social Media Adolescent\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation). Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories began filing lawsuits on these topics in various\nfederal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child\nsexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years\nold. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country.\nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to \"social media addiction\" and\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram.\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions globally concerning the use of our\nproducts and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the\ndesign and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California (DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc.) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the\nplaintiffs' motion for class certification. On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order\ngranting class certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a\npetition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2, 2024, which was denied.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Kadrey,\net al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc.) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York (Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al., which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California)\nalleging that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief.\nThese cases have all been consolidated into Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Vivek H. Murthy, Surgeon General, et al. v. Missouri, et al., on the question of\nwhether federal government officials violated the First Amendment in their communications with the company and others related to content moderation\npractices, and heard argument in Netchoice, et al. v. Paxton and Moody, et al. v. Netchoice et al., regarding the application of the First Amendment relating to\ncontent moderation on tech platforms. As to Murthy, a majority of the Supreme Court decided the case on plaintiffs' standing, declining to rule on the First\nAmendment questions, and sending the case back down to the lower courts where the case continues. As to NetChoice, the Supreme Court unanimously\nvacated the intermediate appellate court decisions, remanding the cases back to the lower courts. Although we are not a party in these actions, the ultimate\nresolution of the lawsuits and similar others still pending in the federal courts could impact our business.\n55",

We are also responding to regulatory inquiries and litigation related to\nallegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to financial scams, in other parts of the world.\nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise\n(NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the\nDirector of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and\nuse for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided\nus with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded\nthrough the NORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a\nlawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,\nRussia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including\nour obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances.

In addition to our historical\nconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual\nresults could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those\ndiscussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of our Family metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant\ncurrency basis is presented in the section entitled \"—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we\ntranslated revenue for the full year 2024 using 2023 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full\ndescription of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \"—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and\npresented in accordance with GAAP.

Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors\nshould be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results.

Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50 billion, an increase of 22% compared to\n2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% compared to 2023. Ad impressions delivered\nacross our Family of Apps in 2024 increased 11% year-over-year, and our average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year.\nIncome from operations for 2024 was $69.38 billion, an increase of $22.63 billion, or 48%, compared to 2023, driven by an increase in advertising\nrevenue, partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to\nour data centers and technical infrastructure and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs.\n59",

We rely on targeting and measurement tools that\nincorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver\nrelevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending\nas a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating\nsystems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, European Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and U.S. state privacy laws\nincluding the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad\nproducts, and an increasing\n60",
    "62": "Table of Contents\nnumber of laws have been introduced limiting or prohibiting the provision of our services to younger users. We expect these and other developments will have\nfurther impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products\nand user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue and user engagement.\nFor example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by\nads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators\non our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or\nannounced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For\nexample, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and\nother iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of\nthe budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are\ndeveloping privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we\nprocess, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data\ninto our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools\nto help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad\nproducts. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery,\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new\nfeatures and scaling existing features.\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for\nadvertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.\nHowever, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will\ncontinue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity\nobligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we\nexpect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our\nuser growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as\ninflation, high interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\nmacroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial\nresults in future periods.\nIn addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI\ninitiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved\nuser engagement and monetization of our products. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics,\nin particular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will\ncontinue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more\nregions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends adversely affected\nadvertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\n61",
    "63": "Table of Contents\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors\ndriving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified\nadvertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision\nwhich advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising\nrevenue during the periods presented.\nInvestment Philosophy\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our operating\nefficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and\n21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to\ndevelop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across\nour products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. In particular, we expect\nour AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices,\nsoftware for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development\nacross these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products that may only be fully\nrealized in the next decade. In 2024, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we continue to expect our RL\noperating losses to increase in 2025. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our RL efforts is dependent\non generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will\nunlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\n62",

Substantially all of our daily active people (as defined below) access our\nFamily products on mobile devices.\n• Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp\n(collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or\nmobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these\nproducts, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a\nsingle person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based\non internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our\nestimates. We view DAP as a measure of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key\nMetrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n- - - - - - \nNote: We report the numbers of DAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and\nerrors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At ourscale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may\nvary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins.

    "69": "Table of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing\nbasis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and\njudgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial\nstatements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the\ngreatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information\non all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\namount can be reasonably estimated.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our\ndefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is\nrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and\nunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated\ninformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations\nregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the Irish Data\nProtection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of\nan inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\nrevised in the future.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably\npossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts that materially differ\nfrom management's estimates of losses, it could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. See Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 —\nIncome Taxes of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"\nand Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our\nactual and forecasted income (loss) before\n68",

These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties\nwith our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities\nsupporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer pricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length\nprices. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for\nincome taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the\nclosing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of\nfuture cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected\nto generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the\ncarrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is\nperformed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not\nlimited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment;\noperational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair\nvalue of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated\nstatements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a\nnon-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of\ndifferences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b)\nadjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most\nadvantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur\nin a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated\nuseful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this\nchange in accounting estimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. For information regarding the change in\nuseful lives of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n69",

Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are\nconsidered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the\naction the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the\nstructure of our ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currently monetized at the\nsame rate as our Feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and\nmonetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price\npaid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the\nprincipal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers\nusing our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and\ncontent.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses\nrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings,\nemployee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to\nprocessing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments;\nand content costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist mostly of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based\ncompensation and benefits for our employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new technologies and products; RL\ntechnology development costs; infrastructure costs; and facilities-related costs.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and\nbenefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions; marketing and promotional\nexpenses; and professional services to support our community and product operations.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based\ncompensation and benefits for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other\nadministrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as\nother legal fees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; and professional services.\n70",

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad.\nIn 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in\nall regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the\naverage price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by\nan increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement\ntools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize\nat lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical\nwas the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a\ncombination of price and ad impressions delivered.\nOther revenue\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by WhatsApp Business Platform\nrevenue.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2024 increased $250 million, or 13%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to an increase in RL consumer hardware products\nsold.\nRevenue Seasonality\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in\nboth advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third\nand fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the\nthird and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17%\ncompared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n72",

Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision\nfor income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from\ncapital losses not expected to be utilized, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based\ncompensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price\nremains constant to the January 24, 2025 price, and absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the\nrange of 12-15%. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2024, as\nrequired by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also\ndecreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax\nrate in 2025 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.\nA number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax\nregime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to\nevaluate the impacts of proposed and enacted legislation with respect to the global minimum tax regime in the jurisdictions we operate in. As additional\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\ntax payments could increase in future years.\n75",

These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer\npricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. The ultimate settlement of the\nliabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of\nlitigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12\nmonths.\nSee Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and\nmarketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, investment\ngrade corporate debt securities, and marketable equity securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial\ninstitutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $77.81 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2024, an increase of $12.41 billion from December 31, 2023. The increase was due to $91.33 billion of cash generated from operations and\n$10.43 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in August 2024. These increases were offset by $39.23 billion\nof capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, our capital returns of $35.20 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and\npayments of dividends and dividend equivalents, and $13.77 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU)\nawards.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 91,328 $ 71,113 $ 50,475 \nNet cash used in investing activities $ (47,150) $ (24,495) $ (28,970)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (40,781) $ (19,500) $ (22,136)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $62.36 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as\n$16.69 billion of share-based compensation expense and $15.50 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in cash flows from operating\nactivities during 2024 compared to 2023, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by\nhigher cash paid for income taxes and other operational spending.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $37.26 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in\nservers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $9.75 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities\nduring 2024 compared to 2023 was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable debt securities and property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 to support our core business and generative AI efforts.\n76",

The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2024 compared to 2023, was mostly\ndue to increases in our capital returns of $10.35 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $5.07 billion for quarterly dividend payments that\nbegan in March 2024, as well as a $6.76 billion increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage\nour business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced\nby purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding\nhow cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better\nunderstand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the\nlimitations of FCF are:\n• FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\n• other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 91,328 $ 71,113 $ 50,475 \nPurchases of property and equipment (37,256) (27,045) (31,186)\nPrincipal payments on finance leases (1,969) (1,058) (850)\nFree cash flow $ 52,103 $ 43,010 $ 18,439 \n77",

We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future\ncapital requirements.\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices and colocations. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure.\nOur facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially change our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to\nour investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs from content providers whom we license video and music to increase engagement on\nthe platform.\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion,\nwhich mature from 2027 through 2064. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of December 31, 2024 were $1.39 billion and\n$28.10 billion, respectively.\nCapital Return Program\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have\nan expiration date.

Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Subject to legally\navailable funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents on\nour outstanding common stock.\nTaxes\nCash paid for income taxes was $10.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had taxes payable of $718 million\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, which is due within one year.\nOur long-term income taxes include $9.99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing of\nthe completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing\nof payments.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. Significant judgment is required to\ndetermine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which\nare beyond our control.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our\nrevenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n— Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring\nmonetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this\ntime, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency\nexchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of\n$690 million, $366 million, and $81 million were recognized in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and\nthe fair value of our long-term debt.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S.\ngovernment agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and\nsupporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, and\nthe market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $680 million and\n$355 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any realized\ngains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to\nmaturity.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes) outstanding of $29.0 billion and\n$18.50 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact\non our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of\ndeclining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the\nfair value or carrying value of our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and our non-marketable equity securities are\ninvestments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values.\n79",
    "81": "Table of Contents\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values, of which\npublicly traded stocks are subject to market price volatility and represent $1.23 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2024. A hypothetical adverse\nprice change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $123 million. We did not hold any\nmarketable equity securities as of December 31, 2023.\nWe elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment,\nadjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not\nlimited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of the companies we invest in\nand, therefore, result in a material impairment or downward adjustment in our investments.

In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in some of\nthese cases, actions or inquiries described above.

A company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 29, 2025\n85",

    "93": "Table of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\nWe report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns with\nhow the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of\nour revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for\nwhich we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nBalance Sheets Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n• Intangible assets, net was reclassified into other assets\n• Partners payable was reclassified into accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n• Long-term income taxes was reclassified out of other liabilities\nThese reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenue, income from operations, net income or cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets\nand liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not\nlimited to, those related to loss contingencies, income taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, and\nfair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and\nexpectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, and determined we should extend the estimated\nuseful lives to 5.5 years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2025.\n92",
    "94": "Table of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when\ncontrol of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for\nthose goods or services.\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are\nrecorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for\ncontracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nRevenue includes sales and usage‑based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass‑through agent.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for\nad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are\nconsidered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the\naction the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred\nto our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the\nagent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the\ncustomer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-\nbased incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these\namounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates\nof variable consideration for the reported periods.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and\ncontent. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that\nreflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nFoA other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our\nPayments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee\ncompensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of\nrevenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing\ncustomer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content\ncosts.\n93",
    "95": "Table of Contents\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.\nWe pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is\naccepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to\ndate.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum\nguaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external\nusers, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services.\nThese software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be\ncompleted and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material\nto date.\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on\nthe grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\nUnder this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax\nrates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the\ndeferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider\nall available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable\nincome and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\ncomponent of the provision for income taxes.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred\nadvertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n94",
    "96": "Table of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions globally and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less\nfrom the date of purchase. We classify amounts in transit from customer credit cards and payment service providers as cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe hold investments in marketable debt securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade\ncorporate debt securities. We classify our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent\ninvestments of cash available for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,\nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair\nvalue are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities\nare recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of\ntaxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable\nsecurities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nWe also hold investments in marketable equity securities that are publicly traded stocks. We classify these equity securities as marketable securities\nwithin current assets on our consolidated balance sheets because they are available to be converted into cash to fund current operations without any restriction.\nThese marketable equity securities are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the resulted unrealized gains and losses recognized in interest and\nother income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, cash reserves designated for a specific purpose, as\nwell as retention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated\nbalance sheets, based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for\nsubstantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. We periodically\nreview our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below its carrying amount,\nwe write down the investment to fair value. The change in carrying value, resulted from the remeasurements, is recognized in interest and other income\n(expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. For additional information, see Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were not material as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value\nin the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\nrequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk\nmeasurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels\nand bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n95",
    "97": "Table of Contents\nLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because\ntheir fair values are derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Certain other assets are\nclassified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When\nindicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make\nestimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of\nvarious factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected credit\nlosses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for\ncredit losses on accounts receivable were not material.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, including finance leases, are depreciated and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets as of December 31, 2024 are\ndescribed below:\nProperty and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets Four to Five years \nBuildings 25 to 30 years\nEquipment and other One to 25 years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets Five to 20 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\n_______________________\n(1) Effective January 2025, the useful lives of certain servers and network assets are extended to 5.5 years.\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable,\nand the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized.\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are management's estimates when the assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the\nremaining estimated useful lives. Our estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may\ndiffer from the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we\nchange the estimated\n(1)\n96",

Land and assets held within\nconstruction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been\nplaced in service for their intended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the\nrelated assets.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated\ndepreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We\ndetermine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed\npayments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a\nsingle lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate\ntaxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase\narrangements, and maintenance and utilities. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain\ncolocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the\ncommencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time\nof commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining\nthe probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. We do not assume renewals in our\ndetermination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual\nvalue guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a\nsimilar economic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on\nour consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nshorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2.43 billion, and $2.22 billion,\nrespectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation\nrestructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant\nassumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases,\nprojected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. For\nadditional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\n97",
    "99": "Table of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\nIf we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in\nthe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their\nestimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to\nidentifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are\nexpensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as\nwhen changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment\ntesting. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the\nfuture undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a\nfinite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment\ncharges of finite-lived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are\nnot amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and\naccounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives\nof finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the\nrevised estimated useful life. Intangible assets are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to\nU.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and\nlosses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\n98",

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax, of $2.66 billion and\n$1.24 billion, respectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved\nare recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions\nwere $690 million, $366 million, and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,\nmarketable debt securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and\nagency securities. Marketable debt securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade\ncorporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our marketable debt\nsecurities are held in diversified highly rated securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual\nissuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 was not material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated\n36%, 37%, and 40% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United\nStates, with a majority of the revenue outside of the United States in 2024 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Australia, India\nand Canada.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses,\nand bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. In the event that accounts receivable\ncollection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nBeginning in 2024 annual reporting, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) that was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This new standard requires an\nenhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. Upon adoption, the guidance was applied retrospectively to all prior\nperiods presented in the financial statements, which resulted in the disclosure of employee compensation costs for each reportable segment. For additional\ninformation, see Note 16 — Segment and Geographical Information.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which\nimproves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate\nreconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax\ndisclosures. This new standard will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. The new standard permits early adoption\nand can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n(Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (ASU 2024-03). The new guidance requires disaggregated information about certain income\nstatement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2027\nand for interim periods thereafter. The new standard permits early adoption and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the effect\nthat this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n99",

Using the expected volume consumption, the total estimated\nspend related to our renewable energy agreements as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $24.97 billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years.\nThe ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on actual volume purchased.\nLegal and Related Matters\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described below, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when\nwe believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in\nsome of these matters. Unless otherwise noted, with respect to the matters described below that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of\npossible loss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility\nthat they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of business. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying\nwith these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such\nobligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government\ninquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when\nwe believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in\nsome of these other matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either\nindividually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved\nagainst us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period\nin which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15 — Income Taxes.\n110",

With\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors\nappealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal\nTrade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a\nsettlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required\nus to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiries and\nlitigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of\nColumbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The\nappeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On\nJuly 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of\nfiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other\nstockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against\ncertain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead\nplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc.\nDerivative Litigation. On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed\nas to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding (In the Matter of Facebook, Inc.) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent\norder, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The\nunderlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to\nrule.\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC),\nasserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On\nDecember 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the\ndistrict court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss\nour complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy (Jarkesy). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending\nappeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy. Following the\nSupreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024.

    "113": "Table of Contents\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was\nlegally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners\non those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta’s jurisdictional challenges currently\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc., and that the nature and scope of any further\nadministrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional\nrequirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate\ncourt to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be\nsuccessful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and\nMember State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding\nvarious aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model\nwith requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on\nStandard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The\nIDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item\n3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's cooperation and\nconsistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending\nour regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe\nthere is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material individually or in the aggregate.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals' information from\nthird-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive\nrelief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor, Inc. et al.; Doe v.\nGoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara\nCounty Superior Court). These cases are in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain others\nhave been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in the cases that are most advanced.\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the\nsubject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint (FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc.)\nagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in\n2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss\nthe complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to\ndismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our\nmotion for summary judgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024.

These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc.

In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17,\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4,\n2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10,\n2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices.

These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child\nsexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years\nold. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country.\nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to “social media addiction” and\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram.\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions globally concerning the use of our\nproducts and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the\ndesign and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California (DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc.) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the\nplaintiffs' motion for class certification. On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order\ngranting class certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a\npetition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2, 2024, which was denied.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Kadrey,\net al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc.) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York (Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al., which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California)\nalleging that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief.\nThese cases have all been consolidated into Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\n114",
    "116": "Table of Contents\nOn April 30, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings against us to assess Facebook and Instagram's compliance with certain\nrequirements under Articles 14, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25, 34, 35, and 40 of the DSA, regarding a range of topics including elections, content reporting and appeals,\nthird-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, including the way in which we identified,\nassessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks on Instagram and Facebook. We are also responding to regulatory inquiries and litigation related to\nallegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to financial scams, in other parts of the world.\nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise\n(NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the\nDirector of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and\nuse for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided\nus with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded\nthrough the NORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a\nlawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,\nRussia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including\nour obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties\nagainst us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously\ndefend such fines and penalties.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain\nmatters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of\nthe claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2024, there was not a reasonable possibility we had incurred a\nmaterial loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. Liabilities recorded for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2024 were not\nmaterial.\n115",

As of December 31, 2024, we are\nauthorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per\nshare. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to\nthe rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to\none vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an\nequivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are collectively referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were 2,190 million shares of Class A common stock and 344 million shares of Class B common stock issued and\noutstanding.\nCapital Return Program\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have\nan expiration date. As of December 31, 2023, $30.93 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2024, an\nadditional $50 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion, which includes the 1% excise tax accruals as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, $51.28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and\nmarket conditions, and other investment opportunities. Shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions,\nincluding through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDividend\nBeginning in February 2024, our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share to the holders of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock. RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2024 under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in\nMay 2024, are entitled to dividend equivalent rights. During the year ended December 31, 2024, total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $4.38\nbillion and $691 million for Class A and Class B common stock, respectively.\nSubject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on\nour outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account\nvarious factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.\nShare-based Compensation Plan\nWe have one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended\nin May 2024. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,\nRSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement\nof RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were 483 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan.\n116",

    "121": "Table of Contents\nThese unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. During all years presented, we recognized interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and\npenalties accrued as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $2.21 billion, $1.48 billion, and $1.07 billion, respectively.\nIf our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $15.13 billion as of December 31, 2024 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of\n$10.11 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to\npotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax\nyears. Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years\nremain open to examination by the IRS. We are under examination by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for our 2020 tax year and our 2021 and subsequent tax\nyears remain open to examination.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years\nsubsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a\npetition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was\ncompleted in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2025 which will likely provide a transfer pricing value for intellectual property\ntransferred. This value will need to be extrapolated into income adjustments to determine the specific tax liability, which will likely remain in dispute and will\nnot be resolved until the Tax Court enters a decision. If the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties\nasserted. Once the Tax Court decision is entered, the IRS and Meta will each have the option to file an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and\ncertain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to\napproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than\nthe potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails\nin its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax\nthat we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2024, we have not\nresolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax\nitems that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining\nthat are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax\nauthorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n120",

Based on the\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nItem 9B.

    "132": "EXHIBIT 19.1\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nI. Background and Purpose\nA. Why have we adopted this policy?\nThis policy has been adopted to help you comply with the federal securities laws and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Under the securities laws, it\nis generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta” or the “Company”) or any other company while in the possession of\nmaterial non-public information about that company. It is also generally illegal for any such person to give material non-public information about Meta or any\nother company to others who then trade on the basis of that information. The consequences of prohibited insider trading or the “tipping” of material non-public\ninformation can be severe for both individuals engaging in such behavior and for Meta. Violators, as well as Meta, its directors and officers and/or the\nmanagers of the person violating the rules may be required to pay major civil or criminal penalties (including jail time) and could be subject to private lawsuits\nin connection with the violation of the insider trading laws.\nB. What is insider trading?\n“Insider trading” occurs when any person PURCHASES or SELLS Meta securities on the basis of material non-public information concerning Meta, or from\ntipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-public information to others. Meta securities include not only stocks, but also include options, restricted\nstock units (“RSUs”), warrants, bonds and notes as well as derivative securities that are not issued by Meta, such as exchange-traded put or call options or\nswaps relating to Meta’s securities. “Purchase” includes not only the actual purchase of a security, but any contract to purchase or otherwise acquire a security.\n“Sale” includes not only the actual sale of a security, but any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of a security.\nDoes this policy also apply to securities of other companies?\nInsider trading on the basis of material non-public information about Meta is prohibited under this policy. In connection with your work at Meta, you may also\nlearn material non-public information about other companies. This policy also prohibits trading in those companies' securities on the basis of material non-\npublic information about those companies learned through your employment at Meta, and prohibits tipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-\npublic information about those companies to others.\nNote that if you learn material non-public information that affects multiple other companies, you may not trade the securities of any of those companies. For\nexample, say you learn that Meta has plans to acquire Company A. The acquisition is not material to Meta but it is material non-public information about\nCompany A. There is also a Company B in the same industry that is economically linked to Company A, such that the announcement of the acquisition of\nCompany A could be expected to affect the stock price of Company B. This policy prohibits trading in securities of both Company A and Company B while in\npossession of that material non-public information.\nC. What is “Material Non-public Information”?\nInformation concerning Meta is considered “MATERIAL” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information\nimportant in making a decision to purchase or sell Meta’s securities. Material information can be positive or negative and can relate to virtually any aspect of\nMeta’s business. \nExamples of material information may include (but are not limited to) facts concerning:\n• historical or forecasted revenues, earnings or other financial results;\n• significant new products or services or other product developments;\n• significant new contracts, customers or partners or the loss of a significant contract, customer or partner;",
    "133": "• significant developments regarding Meta’s technology or business operations;\n• significant, sustained changes in user growth and engagement;\n• possible mergers or acquisitions or dispositions of significant subsidiaries or assets, tender offers, joint ventures, restructurings or curtailment of\noperations; \n• pending or threatened significant litigation or regulatory inquiries or developments in existing litigation or inquiries; \n• significant cybersecurity incidents or data breaches;\n• significant developments in borrowings, or financings or capital investments; \n• significant changes in financial condition or asset value or liquidity issues;\n• changes in debt ratings, or analyst upgrades or downgrades of Meta or its securities; \n• changes in senior management; \n• significant changes in corporate strategy; \n• changes in accounting methods and write-offs; and \n• stock offerings, stock splits or changes in dividend policy.  \nThis list is illustrative only and is not intended to provide a comprehensive list of circumstances that could result in material information. Determination of\nwhat may constitute material information will depend upon the facts and circumstances in each particular situation.\nInformation is “NON-PUBLIC” if it is not available to the general public. In order for information to be considered public, it must be generally available to\ninvestors and widely disseminated through (i) press releases or corporate blog posts issued by Meta, publicly accessible webcasts or conference calls conducted\nby Meta or a public filing made by Meta with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), or (ii) publication in a widely-available newspaper, news\nmagazine or news website. In addition, a sufficient amount of time must pass so that the information has had an opportunity to be digested by the marketplace.\nAs a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until one (1) full trading day after the release of such information.\nOne helpful way to determine if you have material non-public information is to ask yourself, “Would the person on the other side of this transaction\nstill want to complete the trade at this price if he or she knew what I know about Meta?” If the answer is “no,” chances are you possess material non-\npublic information.\nA good general rule of thumb: WHEN IN DOUBT, DO NOT TRADE.\nD. Who is covered under this policy?\nIf you fall under any of the categories below, you are subject to this policy:\n• directors, officers and employees of Meta and its subsidiaries;\n• spouses, domestic partners, dependent children (whether or not minors) and any other family members who live in the same household of any persons\nlisted in the bullet above;\n• consultants and contractors of Meta and its subsidiaries; and\n• any persons or entities or accounts controlled by any of the above or which investment decisions are directed or influenced by any of the above.\nAny trades in Meta securities made on your behalf, including trades by brokers or other third parties, are subject to this policy, and it is your responsibility to\nensure all such trading activity is in compliance with this policy. You should also be aware that trades in Meta securities by other members of your immediate\nfamily (e.g. parents or siblings) as well as unrelated members of your household may be heavily scrutinized based on their proximity to",
    "134": "you. In an insider trading investigation, the burden of proof is often on the insider to prove that trades made by such persons were not the result of information\nthat the insider may have possessed. Accordingly, while we don’t expect you to monitor what is outside of your control, if you are concerned about this\npossibility, we suggest that you send a message to these people informing them of Meta’s regular closed trading period and ask them to comply with the closed\ntrading period.\nE. Who administers this policy?\nThe Company’s Chief Legal Officer administers this policy and serves as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer (the “Insider Trading Policy\nCompliance Officer”). In his or her absence, Meta’s Chief Financial Officer will serve as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer. The Insider Trading\nPolicy Compliance Officer may also designate one or more individuals in the legal department who may perform the functions of the Insider Trading Policy\nCompliance Officer. The Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will review and either approve or prohibit all proposed trades requiring preapproval under\nthis policy according to the procedures set forth in this policy, except that with respect to the Chief Legal Officer, any proposed trades must be approved by\nMeta’s Chief Financial Officer. All determinations and interpretations by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will be final and not subject to further\nreview.\nII. Insider Trading Policies\nOVERRIDING RULE: NO ONE CAN TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION,\nAND NO ONE CAN HELP OR ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-\nPUBLIC INFORMATION.\nA. No Trading on Material Non-public Information\nIf you possess material non-public information, you may not purchase or sell, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, any of Meta’s securities, during\nany period beginning with the date you received the material non-public information concerning Meta, and ending at market open on the second full trading\nday after public disclosure of that information, or at such time when the non-public information is no longer material.\nB. No Trading During Closed Trading Periods; Pre-Clearance of Certain Transactions\n1. Regular Closed Trading Period\nYou may not trade in any security of Meta during the period beginning at market close on the last day of the middle month of any fiscal quarter of Meta and\nending at market open on the second full trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter (a “Regular Closed Trading Period”). For\nexample, if Meta announces its prior fiscal quarter earnings on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 28th, then the Regular Closed Trading Period will end at\nmarket open on Friday, July 30th, and you would potentially be able to trade in the “open trading window” from Friday, July 30th through market close on\nAugust 31st. However, these open trading windows should not be considered a safe harbor, as you are always restricted from trading under this policy if you\npossess material non-public information, even during open trading windows. \n2. Special Closed Trading Period\nThe Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer may suspend trading in Meta securities from time to time for some or all persons subject to this policy because\nof material developments known to Meta or certain persons within Meta and not yet disclosed to the public, as he or she deems appropriate (a “Special Closed\nTrading Period” and together with a Regular Closed Trading Period, a “Closed Trading Period”), and need not provide any reason for such suspension. The\nInsider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee will notify you if you are subject to a Special Closed Trading Period, and may not explain the\nreasons. \n3. Pre-Clearance of Trades of Restricted Persons\nIn addition to being subject to the Closed Trading Periods described above, and subject to the 10b5-1 Trading Plan requirements for 10b5-1 Designated Persons\ndescribed below, all members of the Company’s Board of Directors and “Section 16 officers” (as defined below) and certain other designated employees,\nconsultants and contractors",
    "135": "(collectively, the “Restricted Persons”) will be designated on a “Pre-Clear List” and will be required to pre-clear ALL trades in Meta securities with the Insider\nTrading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee prior to trading in Meta’s securities, even during an open trading window. These Restricted Persons\nmust contact the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer prior to commencing any trade in Meta’s securities. The Company will notify you if you are on the\nPre-Clear List.\nApproval of trades by Restricted Persons on the Pre-Clear List is in the sole discretion of Meta. If a transaction is approved, you must execute the transaction\nwithin five (5) trading days after the day you receive such approval, but in no event after the commencement of a Closed Trading Period. If for any reason you\ndo not complete the trade within five (5) trading days after you receive approval, you must obtain pre-clearance again before you can trade the securities. For\nexample, if the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee approves a trade on a Friday, then you will have until the end of the trading\nday the following Friday to complete your trade.\nAny requests to approve a trade while you are subject to a Closed Trading Period will be denied.\n4. Pre-Clearance of Gifts by 10b5-1 Designated Persons\nAll 10b5-1 Designated Persons must also pre-clear all gifts of Meta securities and transfers of Meta securities for estate planning purposes with the Insider\nTrading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee prior to such transfer, even during an open trading window.\nC. No Tipping\nYou may not tip (i.e. directly or indirectly pass on) material non-public information to any other person where the information may be used by such person to\ntrade in the securities to which such information relates. You may not make recommendations or express opinions as to trading in Meta’s securities. For\nexample, you may not suggest, encourage or recommend that others buy or sell Meta’s securities (or that they refrain from buying or selling in any setting),\nincluding through participation in any investment or stock-related Meta group, message board or other similar medium.\nD. No Margining or Pledging of Company Securities\nYou may not hold Meta securities in margin accounts or pledge such securities as collateral for a loan except in limited circumstances as approved by the\nCompensation, Nominating, & Governance Committee. However, you may maintain a margin account so long as you do not hold Meta securities in the\naccount, or otherwise use the account to trade Meta securities on margin, or otherwise use Meta securities as collateral.\nE. No Trading in Futures or Derivative Securities or Hedging\nYou may not purchase or sell futures or derivative securities relating to Meta securities, or engage in hedging activities relating to Meta securities, including\nexchange traded options to purchase or sell such securities, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds, or other arrangements or\ninstruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of Meta securities.\nInvestments in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) that track a broad-based index (such as the S&P 500) and/or have holdings comprised of less\nthan 10% in Meta stock are exempt from this policy. However, investments in any other mutual fund or ETF where Meta stock comprises 10% or more of such\nfund’s holdings are subject to this policy and shares of such mutual fund or ETF are treated as if they were Meta securities.\nF. No Short Sales\nYou may not sell Meta securities “short” (meaning any transaction in which you would benefit from a decline in the price of the securities).\nG. No Trading on Information Regarding Other Companies\nIf you, in the course of working for Meta, learn of material non-public information about another company, you may not trade in that company’s securities until\nthe information becomes public or is no longer material. You should treat",
    "136": "material non-public information about Meta's business associates with the same care required with respect to information related directly to Meta.\nH. Confidentiality of Non-public Information\nNon-public information relating to Meta is the property of Meta and the unauthorized disclosure or improper use of such information is forbidden. You may not\ndisclose material non-public information to other persons within Meta whose jobs do not require them to have that information, or outside of Meta to other\npersons, unless such disclosure is made in accordance with Meta’s policies regarding the protection or unauthorized external disclosure of information\nregarding Meta. In addition, your confidentiality agreement with Meta provides that Meta confidential information will only be used for the benefit of the\ncompany and solely to the extent necessary to perform your job. Any other use—such as trading on such information for personal benefit/profit—is prohibited.\nIn addition to violating this policy and/or your confidentiality agreement, any unauthorized disclosures or improper use of such information may also violate\nMeta’s agreements with third parties and may be in breach of your fiduciary, loyalty or other duties to Meta. \nIII. Exceptions to Trading Restrictions\nA. 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nTransactions in Meta’s securities that are executed pursuant to an approved trading plan established pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (a “10b5-1 Trading Plan”), will not be subject to this policy. SEC Rule 10b5-1 generally provides an affirmative defense\nfrom insider trading liability under the federal securities laws for securities trading plans that are entered into in good faith when you are not in possession of\nmaterial non-public information and with respect to which you act in good faith for the duration of the plan.\nThe 10b5-1 Trading Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or include a written formula or algorithm, or computer\nprogram, for determining the number of shares, prices and dates. Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any subsequent influence over\nthe amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any\nmodifications, terminations, or other changes of such plans, must be pre-approved by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee and\nmay only be adopted, modified or terminated when you are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.\nSubject to the Transition Period and Affiliated Fund Exclusion provisions described in the Company’s 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy, “10b5-1 Designated\nPersons” (as defined below) are required to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta’s securities, including the sale of Meta securities that\nthey control through a trust or other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and shall not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a\n10b5-1 Trading Plan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate\nplanning purposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable\nentities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan if (a) the\nunderlying gift was effected during an open trading window and (b) the decision to sell such gifted securities is made by an independent investment committee\nwithout any consultation with or influence of the transferor. For purposes of this policy, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” means the following individuals: (i)\nmembers of Meta’s Board of Directors, (ii) Meta’s “officers” as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (collectively, “Section 16 officers”), and (iii) certain other individuals (such as members of management who report directly to Meta’s Chief\nExecutive Officer) who may be designated from time to time by joint approval of the Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nFor more information, see Meta’s 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy.\nB. Bona Fide Gifts and Other Transfers Without Consideration\nBona fide gifts or other transfers without consideration are exempt from this policy; provided that, for gifts or other transfers without consideration made (i) in\na Closed Trading Period or (ii) at a time when you possess material non-public information, the recipient must agree not to sell Meta securities before the\nearliest time after the gift is completed that you are permitted to sell Meta securities on the open market under this policy.

Divorce Agreement or Other Court Orders \nTransfers of Meta securities pursuant to a divorce agreement or settlement, or other similar court order, are exempt from this policy in a Closed Trading Period.\nD. Partnership Distributions \nDistributions of Meta securities by a venture capital partnership or other similar entity with which a Company director is affiliated to its partners, members or\nother similar persons are generally subject to this policy, unless the entity provides evidence satisfactory to the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer that\nsuch entity has adequate policies and procedures in place to ensure that individuals making investment decisions on its behalf would not violate insider trading\nlaws. It is the responsibility of each affected director and the affiliated entity, in consultation with their own counsel, to determine the process and timing for\nany such distributions based on all relevant facts and circumstances and applicable securities laws.\nE. Company Incentive Plans \nThis policy does not apply to (i) the vesting or settlement of RSUs, (ii) the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which Meta elects to withhold shares\nof stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any RSUs or (iii) a sell to cover transaction (x) under which you have previously elected to\nhave a broker sell vested RSUs to cover any applicable tax withholding requirements (so long as such sell to cover election was made in an open window and\nwhen you were not in possession of material non-public information) or (y) which is otherwise mandated by Meta. This policy does apply, however, to any sale\nof Meta shares that you actually receive upon vesting and settlement of your RSUs.\nIV. Penalties for Violation\nViolation of the rules in this policy is grounds for disciplinary action by Meta, including termination of employment. Trading on or tipping (i.e. directly or\nindirectly passing on) material non-public information can also result in disgorgement of all profits and the imposition of substantial fines, extending\nsignificantly beyond any profits made or losses avoided, both for you and Meta. \nV. Individual Responsibility\nYou are individually responsible for complying with this policy, including the determination of whether you possess material non-public information. You may,\nfrom time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in Meta’s securities even if you had planned to make the transaction before learning of any material\nnon-public information and even though you believe you may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting. \nNone of Meta, the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or Meta’s other employees will have any liability for any delay in reviewing, or refusal of, a\nrequest for pre-clearance of any potential trade or a trading plan. Notwithstanding any review of any pre-clearance of a transaction or any review of a trading\nplan, none of Meta, the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or Meta’s other employees assumes any liability for the legality or consequences of such\ntrading plan or transaction to your engagement in or adoption of such transaction or trading plan. \nVI. Inquiries\nPlease direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures of this policy to the Meta legal department. \nVII. Amendments and Waivers\nAmendments to this policy, and waivers requested by any director or Section 16 officer of Meta, must be approved by action of the Board of Directors or the\nCompensation, Nominating & Governance Committee. All other waivers",

    "139": "EXHIBIT 19.2\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\n10b5-1 TRADING PLAN POLICY\n(Amended September 7, 2023)\nI. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\nA. Why has Meta adopted this policy?\nThis policy has been adopted to help you comply with the requirements necessary to properly implement and maintain an approved trading plan\nestablished pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 (a “10b5-1 Trading Plan”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nUnder applicable federal and state securities laws, it is generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta while in the possession of\nmaterial non-public information about the company. Meta has adopted an “Insider Trading Policy” that sets forth the policies and procedures that have\nbeen implemented to assist your compliance with these laws. This policy on 10b5-1 Trading Plans makes reference to and uses terms that are defined\nin the Insider Trading Policy, so please review it in its entirety before reviewing this policy on 10b5-1 Trading Plans.\nB. What is a 10b5-1 Trading Plan?\nAs provided in the Insider Trading Policy, transactions in Meta’s securities that are executed pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 Trading Plan will not be\nsubject to the restrictions of the Insider Trading Policy, and SEC Rule 10b5-1 generally provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability\nunder the federal securities laws for securities trading plans meeting certain conditions, that are entered into in good faith when you are not in\npossession of material non-public information and with respect to which you act in good faith for the duration of the plan.\nC. How does a 10b5-1 Trading Plan Work?\nThe 10b5-1 Trading Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on those matters to an\nindependent third party. Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the\nprice at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any modification or other change of\nsuch plans, must be pre-approved by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer (as set forth in Section II(H) below) and may only be adopted or modified when\nyou are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.\nD. Am I required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan? Am I subject to this policy if I am not required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan, but\ndecide to do so voluntarily?\nSubject to the Transition Period and Affiliated Fund Exclusion provisions described below, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” (as defined below) are\nrequired to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta’s securities, including the sale of Meta securities that they control through a trust\nor other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and will not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a 10b5-1 Trading\nPlan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate planning\npurposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable\nentities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan\nif (a) the underlying gift was effected during an open trading window while not in possession of material non-public information and (b) the decision\nto sell such gifted securities is made by an independent investment committee without any consultation with or influence of the transferor. For\npurposes of this policy, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” means the following",
    "140": "individuals: (i) members of Meta’s Board of Directors, (ii) Meta’s \"officers\" as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, “Section 16 officers”), and (iii) certain other individuals (such as members of management who\nreport directly to Meta’s Chief Executive Officer) who may be designated from time to time by joint approval of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer and\nChief Financial Officer.\nOther personnel who are not 10b5-1 Designated Persons may also adopt 10b5-1 Trading Plans, and those plans will also be subject to this policy in the\nsame manner as plans adopted by 10b5-1 Designated Persons.\nAffiliated Fund Exclusion: For purposes of members of the Board of Directors under this policy, “Meta securities” excludes all Meta securities held or\ncontrolled by venture capital investment partnerships or other similar entities affiliated with such directors, provided such directors or their immediate\nfamily members or an entity formed for the benefit of such directors or their immediate family members are not the primary beneficiaries of such\npartnerships or entities. An immediate family member of a director includes such director’s spouse (or spousal equivalent), parents, stepparents,\nchildren, stepchildren, siblings, dependents, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and any person\n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the director’s household.\nTransition Period: If an individual is appointed to an employee role that is designated as a 10b5-1 Designated Person, or an employee is otherwise\ndesignated as a 10b5-1 Designated Person for the first time, such employee will be entitled to trade Meta securities outside of a 10b5-1 Trading Plan:\n(a) if appointed or designated during an open trading window, for the remainder of such open trading window, or (b) if appointed or designated during\na closed trading window, for the duration of the next open trading window following such appointment or designation; provided however, that the\nforegoing transition period will not apply to any person appointed to a role that is designated a Section 16 officer position and will not apply to any\nperson who was already required to conduct all trades of Meta securities through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan under this policy.\nE. Who should I contact with questions about 10b5-1 Trading Plans?\nMeta’s Chief Legal Officer administers this policy and Meta’s 10b5-1 Plan Standards (attached hereto as Exhibit A), and serves as the 10b5-1\nCompliance Officer (the “10b5-1 Compliance Officer”). In the Chief Legal Officer’s absence, Meta’s Chief Financial Officer will serve as the 10b5-1\nCompliance Officer. The 10b5-1 Compliance Officer may also designate one or more individuals in the legal department who may perform the\nfunctions of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer. All determinations and interpretations by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer will be final and not subject to\nfurther review.\nII. 10b5-1 TRADING PLANS – CONDITIONS OF IMPLEMENTATION\nA person subject to the Insider Trading Policy may adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and engage in transactions in Meta securities pursuant to such plan\nprovided that each of the following conditions is satisfied and the general terms and circumstances of such plan are consistent with Meta’s 10b5-1\nPlan Standards, attached here to as Exhibit A.\nA.

Formulaic Execution or No Exercise of Discretion\nWith respect to any transaction in Meta securities, the 10b5-1 Trading Plan either (i) expressly specifies the amount, price and date, (ii) provides a\nwritten formula or algorithm, or computer program, for determining amounts, prices and dates, or (iii) does not permit the person subject to this policy\nto exercise any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether to effect such purchase or sale, but does allow this",
    "141": "discretion to be exercised by a broker or other authorized third party (provided any broker or authorized third party with such influence does not have\naccess to any material nonpublic information regarding Meta or its securities when exercising such influence). The type of transaction activity under\nthe 10b5-1 Trading Plan must not violate the terms of the Insider Trading Policy, for example, the restrictions on hedging, short sales, or transactions\nin derivative securities. For the avoidance of doubt, the 10b5-1 Trading Plan may provide for transactions in shares underlying RSUs granted by Meta\nfollowing the date of adoption of the 10b5-1 Trading Plan (“Future RSU Grants”), provided that the 10b5-1 Trading Plan specifies the amount, price\nand date of transactions in shares underlying Future RSU Grants.\nC. Timeframe for Adoption, Modification or Termination\nThe 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, Modified (as defined below), or terminated (i) only when the person is not in possession of material nonpublic\ninformation concerning the company or its securities and (ii) not subject to a Closed Trading Period (whether a Regular Closed Trading Period or a\nSpecial Closed Trading Period).

Administrative or other immaterial changes that\ndo not affect the amount, price or timing of purchases or sales under the plan (including, but not limited to: (i) correcting grant identifiers, or (ii)\ncorrecting typos or other scriveners errors) do not constitute a \"Modification.” In addition, re-assignment of a plan to another broker will not constitute\na \"Modification\" provided such re-assignment does not result in any change to existing purchase or sale instructions. In the event of any dispute, the\n10b5-1 Compliance Officer shall determine whether a change to a plan is deemed a Modification. Modifications should be made infrequently.\nD.

    "143": "EXHIBIT A\nMeta’s 10b5-1 Plan Standards\n(Amended January 29, 2023)\n1. Specialized 10b5-1 Broker: Employees and directors who wish to enter into 10b5-1 plans must use Charles Schwab for execution of such plans. This\naligns with Meta’s use of Charles Schwab as Meta’s sole broker for the Meta equity program. By limiting employees and directors to the selected broker\nfor this purpose, Meta hopes to reduce employee fees, facilitate use of 10b5-1 plans by all interested employees, ease administration of plans, and enable\nthe execution of transactions in a more orderly fashion. Charles Schwab shall provide a form of 10b5-1 plan document for use by employees and directors,\nas discussed further in Section 2, below.\n2. Overlapping Plans; Specific Plan Standards for the Broker: Each individual can only have one (1) active trading plan in place at a time. In addition,\neach individual can only have one (1) “single trade” 10b5-1 trading plan during any 12-month period. If you control, or direct or influence investment\ndecisions of, any trust or other entity, you may not enter into a separate trading plan for the trust or other entity, but you may include the shares held by\nsuch trust or other entity in your individual plan.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual may enter into a second trading plan so long as such second plan does not begin trading until after\nall trades under the first plan are completed or expired without execution.\nPlans with Charles Schwab typically utilize specified determinants regarding date(s), prices(s), start and end dates and share amounts to be sold under the\n10b5-1 plan using a template provided by Charles Schwab. Plans with Charles Schwab cannot include determinants that are derived through employee or\ndirector-provided formulas or algorithms, but can include volume weighted average price (VWAP).\n3. Number of Shares: There is no limitation on the number of shares that a 10b5-1 plan can cover; however, each individual share of stock can only be\ncovered by one (1) 10b5-1 plan. In addition, there must be a sufficient number of shares in the 10b5-1-related brokerage account to cover any balance of\nshares available for sale under the applicable 10b5-1 plan.\n4. Duration: A 10b5-1 plan cannot have a duration longer than two years.\n5. Absolute Discretion of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer: The 10b5-1 Compliance Officer shall have absolute discretion to suspend an employee or\ndirector’s eligibility under this policy or otherwise take appropriate measures in the event that an employee or director appears to be cancelling or\nmodifying their plan(s) in a serial fashion and/or in a manner that is not in keeping with the spirit of Rule 10b5-1.\n6. Further Guidance for Section 16 Officers: Employees designated by Meta as subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 16 of the Securities and\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and directors should be mindful of SEC filing requirements and stockholder concerns when designing their 10b5-1\nplans.",
